> Join our Bug Hunting Program by identifying and reporting issues you encounter while using the bot. Not only will you help improve our services, but you'll also receive recognition for your efforts.

## How to Participate

You need to be actively using the bot in order to find bugs. As you use Astro Birb, check for any unexpected behavior, glitches, or errors.
When you find a bug, report it in our Discord server with detailed information and steps to reproduce the issue.
Once your report is verified by our team, you'll be rewarded based on the number of valid bugs you report:
