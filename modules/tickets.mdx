> The **Tickets** module provides an organized system for handling user inquiries, feedback, and issues.  
> It streamlines communication between staff and users by keeping conversations structured and easy to manage.

## How Tickets Work

Tickets are created using **panels** that users can interact with.

- Panels can be **nested**, meaning multiple panels can exist inside a parent panel.
- Each panel can have its own:
  - Ticket category
  - Staff access roles
  - Permissions
  - Automation settings

When a user creates a ticket:
1. A new channel is created in the configured category
2. Staff members can join and assist the user
3. Once resolved, the ticket can be closed and archived for reference

Admins can also configure **ticket quotas** to limit how many tickets a staff member can claim at once.
