title: Staff Panel (Database)
description: Create a public or private staff panel displaying staff ranks, timezones, and details.
---

> The **Staff Panel** module allows you to create a structured staff database that displays staff members, their ranks, and timezones in an easy-to-read panel.

> Difference from the [Staff List](stafflist.mdx): Staff Panel is more detailed. You can view individual staff member information, including introductions, while the Staff List is a simple list of staff members and their ranks.

---

## Enabling the Staff Panel

1. Ensure the **Staff Panel** module is enabled.
2. Run `/config` and select **Staff Panel**.
3. (Optional) Customize the embed to match your server’s theme.
