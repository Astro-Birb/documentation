> **Promotions** allow you to celebrate and recognize staff achievements by promoting them through a structured hierarchy of roles. This system supports three different promotion systems to fit your server's needs.


## OG System

The OG system is based on Discord roles. You can select a role while using `/promote`, and the user will be promoted to that role without any additional actions. The reverse is also true; you can demote a user by selecting a lower role.

## Single Hierarchy

The Single Hierarchy system allows you to create a structured hierarchy of roles. When using this system, you select roles through the `/config` command to define the hierarchy. Astro Birb will automatically put in place the correct roles regardless of the order you choose the roles while configuring. When you use `/promote`, the user will be promoted to the next role in the hierarchy.

## Multi Hierarchy

The Multi Hierarchy system is similar to the Single Hierarchy system but allows for multiple departments, which have their own hierarchy of roles.

### Configuration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Options">
  - `System`: OG / Single Hierarchy / Multi Hierarchy
  - `Promotion Channel`: The channel where promotion messages will be sent.
  - `Cooldown`: The cooldown time between promotions for a user.
  - `Webhooks`: Enable or disable webhooks for promotion messages.
  - `Promotion Audit Log`: The channel where promotion audit logs will be sent.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Preferences">
  - `Promotion Issuer Button`: A disabled button that displays the username of the issuer at the bottom of the promotion embed.
  - `Auto Role`: Automatically roles the user the rank you specify on the promote command.
  - `Show Issuer`: If disabled on the embeds the issuer will not be displayed. It won't work with customised embeds & it will still appear on /promotions.
