## Managing Staff Ranks

The Staff List uses a rank-based system. Ranks must be created before staff members can be assigned.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="/staff list add">
    Adds a new rank to the staff list.

    **Usage:**  
    `/staff list add [rank] [position]`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="/staff list remove">
    Removes an existing rank from the staff list.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="/staff list send">
    Sends the staff list embed to a selected channel.

    This should be used **after** all ranks and staff members have been added.
